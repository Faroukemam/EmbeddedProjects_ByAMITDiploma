# 🚀 EmbeddedProjects_ByAMITDiploma

This repository contains embedded systems projects submitted as part of the **AMIT Diploma** program. Each project showcases hands-on experience with microcontrollers, sensors, and real-world problem-solving using embedded C and hardware integration.

## 📁 Projects

### 1. 🤖 Autonomous Vehicle Obstacle Avoidance
A robotic vehicle that uses ultrasonic sensors to detect and avoid obstacles in real time. The system is designed for autonomous navigation and safety-critical applications.

- **Microcontroller**: [e.g., ATmega32]
- **Sensors**: Ultrasonic distance sensors
- **Features**:
  - Real-time obstacle detection
  - Automatic path redirection
  - Motor control with PWM

### 2. 🧤 GloveForDeaf
A wearable smart glove that translates sign language gestures into audible speech or digital text, aiding communication for the hearing-impaired.

- **Microcontroller**: [e.g., ATmega32]
- **Sensors**: Flex sensors, IMU (accelerometer/gyroscope)
- **Features**:
  - Gesture recognition
  - Real-time text/speech output
  - Low-power wearable design
